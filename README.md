## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This app was made by using the Open trivia API. The API can be found here https://opentdb.com/api_config.php. This API was simple and easy to use, and I found many interesting fun facts while making this project.

## Optimizations

Optimizations planned are refactoring and faster answer checking.

## Lessons Learned:

The hardest part about this project for me was the logic to get the actual quiz to work. I learned a lot about arrays and manipulating the DOM. I ran into many errors when checking the user answer to the correct answer. Once I figured out how to keep track of the correct choice each question, I managed to get it to work.
