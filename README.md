# Quizknot
This is a fun and simple trivia app. You can choose the number of questions you will be quizzed on, the category, the difficulty, as well as whether the quiz will be a true or false quiz or a multiple choice quiz. I used the Open Triva API to build this project. The API can be found here https://opentdb.com/api_config.php
